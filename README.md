### 📝 Approaches

- These are end-to-end tests of APIs. However, usually it is possible to replace the e2e tests by unit, contract and/or integration tests with the same level of confidence, mainly if our project uses Spring Boot.
- I would mock the repositories. However, in this e2e case, I decided to hardcode 1 user in the e2e environment and take strong care of this data.
  The reason for this is that I would not have to create a new user (and after delete it) on every test.
  If the registration API fails then we would see a false result for all of the endpoints, and could not test/deploy them.
- Usually I use [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) but that would require certain configurations to make it work in an IDE. 
- I could have used [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) for the matchers, but I really do not have a preference on this, so I went on the traditional way this time.
- [Object Mother](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html)
> It could make use of [fluent builder](https://reflectoring.io/objectmother-fluent-builder/) too but it would be overengineering for this application.
- The tests would be located inside the application's repo, see my [article](https://medium.com/justeattakeaway-tech/where-to-save-test-automation-scripts-c19642a07cb3) on the reasoning.
